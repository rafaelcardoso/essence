# Rewrites

Rewrites are handled by `lib/htaccess.php`. Rewrites currently do not happen for child themes or network installs.

When active these rewrites will happen:

* `/wp-content/themes/essence/assets/css/` to `/assets/css/`
* `/wp-content/themes/essenc/assets/js/` to `/assets/js/`
* `/wp-content/themes/essenc/assets/img/` to `/assets/img/`
* `/wp-content/plugins/` to `/plugins/`
